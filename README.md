A genetic algorithm (GA) is a heuristic search technique inspired by natural selection. A population of candidate solutions to a problem is iteratively evolved towards an optimal solution (as measured by an evaluation function) by:
 a) Evaluating the ‘fitness’ of candidate solutions according to the evaluation function
 b) Probabilistically selecting ‘fitter’ candidate solutions from the population to act as
‘parents’ for the next generation of candidate solutions
 c) Introducing constrained novelty to the new generation via operations analogous to
reproduction and mutation. (Note: the selection function will then tend to remove ‘bad’ novelty).
